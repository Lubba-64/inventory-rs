# inventory-rs

A framework for generalizing inventory logic and abstracting it away from
item data in your specific game.

## Design specifications

- Everything should be interchangeable and as generic as possible.
- The architecture should support item instance data and item metadata.
- Should be very reliable (made in rust + unit tests).
- Fast to set up in new games.
